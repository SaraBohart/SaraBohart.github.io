## Motor
### Requirements 
The motor must be able to create an [RCF](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/support/calculators-and-apps/g-force-calculator?srsltid=AfmBOop8NaSsvon0b_BEHic9ZCmkiujIRdpJg4A7WGM2Ohh8W5gX9p2s) that emulates the gravity of Jupiter (25.92 m/s^2 or 2.640 times the earthâ€™s gravity according to [NASA](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/jupiterfact.html)). The Innovation Hub has 3D printers with build areas of 25x21x21 cm, so the projected radius of the centrifuge as of 2/7/25 is 10.5 cm. That means the motor must achieve a loaded speed of 150 RPM. The required torque is estimated to be 4.97 mNm. This changes depending on the shape of the centrifuge the team decides to use. This number assumes a 1 cm thick, solid, PLA disk.
### Options
Option 1|Pros|Cons|
----------|----|----|
![Image of Motor option 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ea4ea9f-ae1e-49a3-9477-d736d1bb7b94) <br> 381-3642-ND <br> GEARMOTOR 150 RPM 24V PLANETARY <br> Individual Cost: $475.38 <br> [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/ebm-papst-inc/VG-VD4915BK1-P63-2-30/9598045) | RPM - This motor is rated for 150 RPM which is the fastest we will need the motor to go. <br> Torque - The torque rating of 7050 mNm is more than enough to spin the centrifuge.|Expensive - The budget is $60 per team member ($240 for the whole team) and I am not able to pay for this out of pocket. <br> Lead Time - The Manufacturer Standard Lead Time is listed as 16 weeks, which is too long for the project to wait.|

Option 2|Pros|Cons|
----------|----|----|
![Image of Motor option 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47ec94f5-9dc7-471b-86b4-758c30d06072)942-PAN14EE12MD-ND <br> STANDARD MTR DC BRUSH 300MM LEAD <br> Individual Cost: $4.75 <br> [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nmb-technologies-corporation/PAN14EE12MD/6035766) |Wire Leads - These will make it easier to connect the motor to the system than if the motor came with an encoder and all the terminals that come with that. <br> Torque - The torque rating is 4.9 mNm, which should be enough if the centrifuge is made of PLA. |Gear Train Needed - This motor is rated for 12800 RPM, so a significant gear reduction will be needed to get to the preferred speed. These gears would need to be sourced or 3D printed because the motor does not come with them. <br> Voltage - It needs 12V which is much higher than the 3.3 that the microcontroller uses.|

Option 3|Pros|Cons|
----------|----|----|

These gears would need to be sourced or 3D printed because the motor does not come with them. <br> Voltage - This motor also takes 12V, which will require a second power source.|

### Selection
Option 2 <br>
The best choice for this project is the 942-PAN14EE12MD-ND because it is the cheapest of the three and should be strong enough to power the centrifuge. While this motor will require 12V, the system can utilize a switching regulator that brings the voltage down to 3.3V for the other components.

## Switching Power Supply
### Requierments
The switching voltage regulator must output 3.3 V from a 12 V source. 
### Options
Option 1|Pros|Cons|
----------|----|----|

Option 2|Pros|Cons|
----------|----|----|

Option 3|Pros|Cons|
----------|----|----|

### Selection
Option 2 <br>
Option 2 is optimal because it has free shipping, a low price, and works nicely with Altium. 

## Motor Driver
### Requierments
The motor driver must use eirthe SPI or I2C communication per the project requierments.
### Options
Option 1|Pros|Cons|
----------|----|----|

Option 2|Pros|Cons|
----------|----|----|
![Motor Driver Option 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce842184-4fc4-433f-be93-381d6b27d00f) <br> NCV7703CD2R2G <br> IC HALF BRIDGE DRVR 1.1A 14SOIC <br> Individual Cost: $3.60 <br>  [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/onsemi/NCV7703CD2R2G/7325621)|Supply Voltage - The supply voltage range is 3.15 - 5.25 V, so this chip can operate on the 3.3 V regulator. <br> Only uses Serial Communication - There is no other option than what is required by the project.|New chip - THis chip is not used in the class, so new bugs will be harder to address. <br> Lead Time - The Manufacturer Standard Lead TIme is 33 Weeks, so if DigiKey runs out of this part before we purchase it, the team will not be able to use this part.|

Option 3|Pros|Cons|
----------|----|----|
![Motor Driver Option 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/349d41eb-22a5-4fdc-8b02-cdc659e0921e) <br> NCP51530BDR2G <br> Half Bridge (2) Driver General Purpose Power MOSFET 8-SOIC <br> Individual Cost: $2.23 <br> [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/onsemi/NCP51530BDR2G/8636481)|Cost - This is the least expensive of the researched motor drivers. <br> Supply Voltage - This chip can run on the 12 V rail.|Very Short Datasheet - The datasheet is very short and does not have as much information as the other chips <br> Pin Names - Pin Names are different from those used in the class, so translating learning will be a step more difficult.|

### Selection
Option 2 <br>
This is the best choice because it is a simplified version of the chip used in class with a data sheet that provides a lot of information on how to use it.

## Microcontroler
### Requierments
The microcontroler needs to support the selected motor driver and communicate through UART with the sensor and the OLED systems. To accomplish this, it will need one UART and one I2C subsystem. This will be a total of 4 pins 2 for I2C and 2 for UART RX and TX.

### My Role
My role as a team member is to plan and lead meetings to ensure that we are staying on track as a group. My section of the project is the actuator system. I need to design something that takes information from the distance sensor, uses that information to pick a spin speed, drives a motor to spin at that speed, and communicate that speed with the OLED system. 

### Test Project
This is a screenshot of my test project for this microcontroller.

### Selection
As of 2/7/25, I am using the PIC18F47Q10. This microcontroller opperates with in the planned voltage, has enough pins for my design, and is used in the class, ensuring that I have many people I can turn to for advice.
