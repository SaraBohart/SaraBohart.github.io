## Motor
### Requirements 
The motor must be able to create an [RCF](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/support/calculators-and-apps/g-force-calculator?srsltid=AfmBOop8NaSsvon0b_BEHic9ZCmkiujIRdpJg4A7WGM2Ohh8W5gX9p2s) that emulates the gravity of Jupiter (25.92 m/s^2 or 2.640 times the earthâ€™s gravity according to [NASA](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/jupiterfact.html)). The Innovation Hub has 3D printers with build areas of 25x21x21 cm, so the projected radius of the centrifuge as of 2/7/25 is 10.5 cm. That means the motor must achieve a loaded speed of 150 RPM. The required torque is estimated to be 4.97 mNm. This changes depending on the shape of the centrifuge the team decides to use. This number assumes a 1 cm thick, solid, PLA disk.

These gears would need to be sourced or 3D printed because the motor does not come with them. <br> Voltage - It needs 12V which is much higher than the 3.3 that the microcontroller uses.|

These gears would need to be sourced or 3D printed because the motor does not come with them. <br> Voltage - This motor also takes 12V, which will require a second power source.|

### Selection
The best choice for this project is the 942-PAN14EE12MD-ND because it is the cheapest of the three and should be strong enough to power the centrifuge. While this motor will require 12V, the system can utilize a switching regulator that brings the voltage down to 3.3V for the other components.

## Switching Power Supply
### Requierments
The switching voltage regulator must output 3.3 V from a 12 V source.
