By making this power budget, I was able to gage what power source I would need. It allowed me to estimate the necissary voltage and current to supply to my system. <br>
This power budget assumes that the system will be powered using an outlet via an adapter such as [this](https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Signcomplex-100-240V-Transformers-Switching/dp/B074HRM5D4?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=A3AI1Y9BXQD9K&th=1). Since the power source is an outlet and not a battery, the battery life is inefinite. It makes more sense for this project to be powered through a stationary wall outlet because it would be used in an enviornment like a museum, where the motor will not need to be transported often.<br>

Durring testing, the original H-Bridge caught on fire. It was though that this issue was caused by the 4 amp power supply, so the amprage was brought down to 2. [This](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086T1N5R4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) is the powersource that was used at the innovation showcase. It had enough power to power the whole team and the motor.
