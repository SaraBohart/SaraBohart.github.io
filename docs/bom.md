This table details everything that was bought and used in this project. As the motor never arrived, It is labeled as free. The manufacturing cost reflects the actual price of the closest motor that I could find to the one we used. <br>
The .xlxs file can be downloaded for easier veiwing: [Bill of Materials Example.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20051270/Bill.of.Materials.Example.xlsx) <br>
Note that any part found in the peralta Lab or in the 3x4 course may not be the exact part, as those were never purchased by me and most do not include part numbers on them. They are the closest parts I could find to the ones available in the Peralta Labs.

This document details every component that is expected to be used in the final design of my motor system. This is in the format that Altium Exports, as not all of these components were actually purchaced. This is meant to give a list of what would be needed for version 2.0. <br>
