This is the current schmatic of the Motor Driver System as of 2/23/2025. It includes the Switching regulator that will be used to filter the power supply to the motor down to the 3.3V required by the PIC Microchip. Then it displays the motor driver with the motor connected. The PIC is shown with net names that connect its pins to the appropriate pins on the other components. The three remaining boxes show header clusters which will be used to connect the system to other systems and to the MPLab debugger that we are using in class.
