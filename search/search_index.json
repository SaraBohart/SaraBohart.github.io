Per the project requirements, the motor must communicate with the microcontroller through an \u201ccomplex motor driver IC\u201d. I have decided to use the IFX9201SGAUMA1 from Infineon Technologies because we are also using that component in class. This will remove a layer of complexity, allowing me more time to focus on other areas of the course and the project, and save some money as my team will not have to buy as many parts. For the same reason, the microcontroller I have chosen is the DIP version of the PIC18F47Q10. Since both of these components are used in the class, our team saves time and money, which can be used on other aspects of the project. More research needs to be done on gravity emulation.

Torque - The torque rating of 7050 mNm is more than enough to spin the centrifuge. Expensive - The budget is \\(60 per team member (\\)240 for the whole team) and I am not able to pay for this out of pocket.  Lead Time - The Manufacturer Standard Lead Time is listed as 16 weeks, which is too long for the project to wait. Option 2 Pros Cons 942-PAN14EE12MD-ND  STANDARD MTR DC BRUSH 300MM LEAD  Individual Cost: $4.75  DigiKey Wire Leads - These will make it easier to connect the motor to the system than if the motor came with an encoder and all the terminals that come with that.  Torque - The torque rating is 4.9 mNm, which should be enough if the centrifuge is made of PLA. Gear Train Needed - This motor is rated for 12800 RPM, so a significant gear reduction will be needed to get to the preferred speed. These gears would need to be sourced or 3D printed because the motor does not come with them.  Voltage - It needs 12V which is much higher than the 3.3 that the microcontroller uses. Option 3 Pros Cons  PAN14EE12AA1  STANDARD MOTOR 12850 RPM 12V  Individual Cost: $5.22  DigiKey Torque - The data sheet indicates that this motor can work with 4.9 mNm, which should be enough for our centrifuge.  Cost - This motor is very cost effective as it only costs $5.22. Gear Train Needed - This motor is rated for 12850 RPM, so a gear reduction will be needed. These gears would need to be sourced or 3D printed because the motor does not come with them.  Voltage - This motor also takes 12V, which will require a second power source. Option 4 Pros Cons  25SG-370CA 6V 25D Metal Gearmotor, 280rpm Individual Cost: $6.58  RoboShop Cost - For a gear motor this is not very expencive.  Comes with mounting - There is an aluminum mount for the shaft and mounting holes to attach the motor to the project.

Shipping Fee - The shipping fee for this chip is $8 because it is a marketplace product.  Only one output - There is only one output, so all 3.3 V power will be drawn from the single pin. Option 2 Pros Cons  LM2655MTC-3.3/NOPB  IC REG BUCK 3.3V 2.5A 16TSSOP  Individual Cost: $4.66  DigiKey Texas Instruments - This is a big name manufacturer that can be trusted.  No Shipping fee - There is no additional shipping fee.  Same Ratings - This part has the same ratings as option 1. Expensive - Despite having the same ratings as option 1, this chip is significantly more expensive.  Many pins - This chip has a lot of small pins that need to be soldered very carefully without overheating the chip.

Supply Voltage Range - The chip requires 5-36 V, which includes 12 V, so no new regulator is needed. Supply Voltage Range - 3.3 V is too low for this cip, so It could not pull power from the voltage regulator.  Too many features - This chip has the capacity to be controlled by PWM, but the project requires that only I2C or SPI are used.

Only uses Serial Communication - There is no other option than what is required by the project. New chip - THis chip is not used in the class, so new bugs will be harder to address.

Option 3 Pros Cons  NCP51530BDR2G  Half Bridge (2) Driver General Purpose Power MOSFET 8-SOIC  Individual Cost: $2.23  DigiKey Cost - This is the least expensive of the researched motor drivers.
